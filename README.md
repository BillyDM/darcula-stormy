## This theme is inspired by the Darcula theme in the IntelliJ/PHPStorm editors

* The font colours and backgrounds are very similar to IntelliJ Darcula.
* Due to the Visual Studio Code textmate selectors not being able to select some of the editor elements in the same way IntelliJ does, some elements can't be coloured correctly.
* The theme is currently focused on PHP, shell and SQL language modes, but I am happy to add support for other languages if a PR with changes is submitted.

This is a work in progress. Where possible, I will continue to improve it. Please feel free to submit a pull request if you can make any improvements.
