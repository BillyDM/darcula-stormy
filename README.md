# Darcula Stormy Visual Studio Code Theme
## This theme is inspired by the Darcula theme in IntelliJ/PHPStorm editors

* The font colours and backgrounds are very similar.
* Due to the VSCode textmate selectors not being able to some of the individual elements in the same way IntelliJ does, some elements can't be coloured correctly.

This is a work in progress. Where possible, I will continue to improve it. Please feel free to submit a pull request if you make any improvements.

**Enjoy!**
