# Darcula Stormy Visual Studio Code Theme
## This theme is inspired by the Darcula theme in the IntelliJ/PHPStorm editors

* The font colours and backgrounds are very similar to IntelliJ Darcula.
* Due to the Visual Studio Code textmate selectors not being able to select some of the editor elements in the same way IntelliJ does, some elements can't be coloured correctly. 

This is a work in progress. Where possible, I will continue to improve it. Please feel free to submit a pull request if you can make any improvements.

**Enjoy!**
